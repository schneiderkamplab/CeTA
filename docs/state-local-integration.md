# State-local checker integration

The authoritative [Ferrum architecture contract](../../ferrum/docs/architecture.md) governs this implementation. Follow its [processor](../../ferrum/docs/processor-contract.md), [identity](../../ferrum/docs/state-identity.md), [guidance](../../ferrum/docs/guidance-contract.md), and [release](../../ferrum/docs/release-gates.md) contracts.

The snapshot starts at CeTA main 6ce5ab3. Historical unified ITS validation is retained under `unified-its-20261027/`. No checker logic changed in this milestone. Preserve the independently built unified executable and verified libraries; fix stale callers rather than substituting category executables. Regenerate affected exports from Isabelle. Release evidence must bind every category to one immutable executable hash.

The full architecture release has not passed: independent CeTA-Lean ITS coverage and the new 15-category two-checker replay remain open. Cross-repository links target the maintained sibling Ferrum checkout; release evidence must pin the repository revisions. CeTA checking logic and the installed executable remain unchanged.

## Existing triple checkers connected to the unified adapter

Revision `3344eae` connects the already exported initial and return-family triple
checking functions to the LP adapter. No generated module, Isabelle theorem or
export archive changed; all other category libraries retain their hashes.
The isolated O2 binary is
`b4165eefc964f4417cb184cc4545f7437dbcfd2acacca15f2f7ed122c6406a52`.
The installed main executable is unchanged. The candidate passes 49 retained
LP/cut positive certificates and 49 negatives, plus dispatch rejection tests.
Ferrum `7a7fc41` separately passes six fresh initial-triple proof runs with two
checks each and six semantic mutations. Return-triple families still require
fresh per-family migration gates. The full-frontier gate remains open.
[Recorded regression checks](data/lp-triples-dispatch-3344eae-validation.json)
and the private build at `target/unified-lp-triples` retain the evidence.

## Finite LP artifact dispatch

Revision `54a99ee` adds the existing Isabelle-generated finite-LP checker to the
same LP library and unified dispatcher. The imported export is byte-identical
to the verified `lp-finite-production-v2-20261021` snapshot; its four recorded
LP theory files are byte-identical to the current checkout. The preserved
[export identity](data/lp-finite-export-20261021-identity.json) records its source
revision and parent environment. No existing generated module was edited, and
other category libraries retain their archive hashes.

The isolated O2 executable at `target/unified-lp-finite/ceta` has SHA-256
`c89d366b2d2c57d73f8fe13157975882814a0af1cff2ebba6584bfbfdb9e0f44`.
It passes 346 positive checks and 81 negative checks, including all 91 retained
cut roots, plus the finite-artifact and unified-dispatch regression tests.
[Validation evidence](data/lp-finite-unified-54a99ee-validation.json).
The previous `b4165eef...` candidate and main executable are preserved. This
is a checker-library regression gate, not a new full-frontier replay.

## CSR rule-removal / GM composition candidate

The current candidate adds signature-preserving rule-removal soundness lemmas
in `CSR_Signature_Rule_Removal.thy` and composes arbitrary polynomial/matrix
removal prefixes with GM in `CSR_GM_Transformation.thy`. GM's conclusion is
signature-restricted; the composition preserves the caller's signature rather
than assuming unrestricted termination of the residual. The parser accepts an
optional sequence of `ruleRemoval` children inside `csrGmTransformation`;
existing artifacts use an empty sequence.

The complete production Isabelle build and export passed with proof checking
enabled. The new unified O2 checker has SHA-256
`c3e853ea0a13cd5543797f6d6e5e0ece8046b9102a708a42cb607ee1f539da49`.
It passes eight positive checks over four composition fixtures and rejects all
20 semantic mutations. All 110 retained CSR certificates pass two checks each.
The reproducible fixture gate is `tests/unified/check_csr_gm_composition.py`.

[Export identities and certificate evidence](data/csr-gm-composition-20261029-validation.json)
record the source snapshot, generated-module hashes and checking results.
Only the CPF generated module changed; other category exports remain unchanged.
No generated checking logic was edited. The old export archive and production
executable are preserved. Fresh native/strict replay and the full-frontier gate
remain pending. See Ferrum's
[composition contract](../../ferrum-state-local/docs/csr-proof-composition.md)
for state identity and runtime integration gates.

## Sparse tiling: local simulation infrastructure

The isolated `codex/policy-sparse-tiling` worktree starts from checker source
`0a3cca39bf93b0b43b44d89c95d439e93279d603`. Session
`Sparse_Tiling_Construction` now checks the string-step context lemma, closure
of chains inside an invariant language, and transfer of local termination
through a step simulation. The gate passes in `target/sparse-tiling-build-4.log`
with Isabelle2025-2 and AFP snapshot `/work/dfm/afp-2026-07-21`.
The source is `thys/Sparse_Tiling/Sparse_Tiling_Simulation.thy`.

The first attempt was stopped during broad AFP metadata discovery; attempts two
and three contain failed proof obligations, preserved alongside the successful
fourth attempt. The proof contains no admissions. Builds use a private Isabelle
home and persistent temporary directory under this worktree's `target/`.

This is proof infrastructure only. Instantiation for the concrete shift algebra,
RFC coverage, executable certificate checks, parsing, and unified dispatch are
unfinished. No generated checker logic, library export, or CeTA executable has
changed. Ferrum's learned-policy campaigns continue with their pinned checker.

The concrete `Sparse_Tiling_Paths` theory now passes the same isolated session
in `target/sparse-tiling-build-9.log`. It defines shift runs and tile paths and
proves their append laws, preservation of state length, the explicit suffix
formula, synchronization, and contextual simulation of a source rewrite by a
supplied tiled rule. Attempts five through eight retain intermediate proof
failures; the final session checks both theories without admissions.

This proves the path-level simulation component, not the complete sparse-tiling
processor. Language closure from finite checks, RFC coverage, term/source
correspondence, certificate parsing and executable dispatch are still missing.
Generated checking code and the pinned executable remain unchanged.

`Sparse_Tiling_Language` now verifies the accepted-language component. Its
explicit tile condition implies closure under source rewriting and simulation
of each bordered source step; termination of the tiled system then implies
local termination on that accepted language. The gate passes in
`target/sparse-tiling-build-11.log`, with attempt ten's failed obligations
preserved. Nonempty source left sides and equal border/state lengths are
explicit assumptions.

This result still assumes the tile condition rather than proving an executable
finite check for it. Initial/RFC coverage, source-term correspondence and
certificate integration remain unfinished. No checker executable changed.
